# UWP-Document-Scanner

The project demonstrates how to use UWP's WebView and the [Dynamic Web TWAIN](https://www.dynamsoft.com/web-twain/overview/) JavaScript library to create a document scanning app.

## Build the App

Use Visual Studio with Windows 10 SDK to open the project and build the app.

You need to download [Dynamic Web TWAIN 17.1](https://www.dynamsoft.com/web-twain/downloads) and put the `Resources` folder in the project's DWT folder. Remember not to overwrite the `dynamsoft.webtwain.install.js` file.
